The current implementation is satisfy all requirements below, only 'Implicit requirements'
as very controversial topic can be subject for debate at some point.

 RevolutAccountAPI Application Server started with WADL available at http://localhost:8080/RevolutAccountAPI/application.wadl
 
'''
Backend Test
Design and implement a RESTful API (including data model and the backing implementation)
for money transfers between accounts.
Explicit requirements:
1. You can use Java, Scala or Kotlin.
2. Keep it simple and to the point (e.g. no need to implement any authentication).
3. Assume the API is invoked by multiple systems and services on behalf of end users.
4. You can use frameworks/libraries if you like (except Spring), but don't forget about
requirement #2 – keep it simple and avoid heavy frameworks.
5. The datastore should run in-memory for the sake of this test.
6. The final result should be executable as a stand alone program (should not require
a pre-installed container/server).
7. Demonstrate with tests that the API works as expected.
Implicit requirements:
1. The code produced by you is expected to be of high quality.
2. There are no detailed requirements, use common sense.
Please put your work on github or bitbucket.

### Run Unit tests here to verify code - test.java.com.revolut.account.service.AccountServiceImplTest

### Run Integration tests here to verify application functionality - test.java.com.revolut.account.RevolutAccountAPITest
But be sure that application is working in order to execute those tests

Note: Due to very limited availability during last 2 weeks (from 2019-10-07 to 2019-10-21) I was not able to
	  provide better implementation so far. I start having some motivational issues to proceed any further efforts in order
	  to reach acceptable quality level for this project.
